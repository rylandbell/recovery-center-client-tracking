      content: 'Actually, ET is an ideal fit when you consider that Dame and cj were more or less responsible for 100% of the ball handling and playmaking for the Blazers last year. ET gives them a third facilitator and allows Dame and cj to operate off the ball (where they both excel) and allows them to get a bit more rest. We had to have at least one of them on the floor at all times last year. This gives us a LOT more flexibility.',
