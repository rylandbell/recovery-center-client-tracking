# Wasatch CMS

A web application for clincians at a substance abuse recovery facility to use for:

* Tracking clients
* Submitting notes after client meetings
* Tracking data that clients submit via a separate iOS app
* Setting up availability slots for their youcanbook.me account
* Messaging their clients

It's very much a work in progress, and is being shared here only as a work sample for my professional portfolio.

## Usage

Message me if you're interested in viewing this app, and haven't already been given log-in credentials by me. I'm happy to share access, but don't want to post credentials publicly.
